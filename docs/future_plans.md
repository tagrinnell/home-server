# Future Considerations:

Need some sort of Reverse Proxy / Domain Resolution for:
- Easy connections to server (jelly.domain.whatever instead of localhost:port)
- 

Options:
1. Pangolin -- Also messes with tunnels and stuff ; useful for remote access probably (alternative to cloudflare tunnels)?
  - docs.fossorial.io
  - Probably a domain too for easy remote access -- namecheap.com
  - Encryption -- Let's Encrypt => Having https for generally everything would be nice
2. Nginx / Apache (leaning towards Nginx for the reverse proxy, it doesnt look like apache does the same stuff)

kodi.tv
- Maybe useful with Jellyfin integration for native playback on TVs?
Not sure if this is going to be particularly useful in terms of playback on TVs (Plex and Jellyfin might be enough as it is)

3. Overseerr
4. Prowlarr
5. Sonarr
6. Radarr
7. Gluetun
8. QbitTorrent / Deluge 

PC Specs:
- Ryzen 9800X3D
- 3070 TI

Laptop:

No PSU\
No GPU\
No Storage\
No Case

Maybe this summer/eventually:
- Get a big hard drive to eventually use on the "server"
- Start looking into specs for the server
- Need windows (10 hopefully, please not 11) for gaming with Pookie
